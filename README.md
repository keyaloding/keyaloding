  About Me
</h2>

I am a rising fourth-year student at the University of Chicago studying
computer science with a strong foundation in backend development and growing
experience in frontend development. I am currently a software engineering intern
at Vertex Inc on the performance engineering team. I have previously worked as a
software engineering intern at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. I'm
now looking for opportunities to apply my programming and problem-solving skills
to create impactful software solutions. Please feel free to reach out if you'd
like to connect! I am looking at new-grad opportunities starting in July/August
2026.

### [CrustyDB](https://github.com/uchicago-cmsc23500-spr-2025/crustydb-keyaloding) | *Rust* | April 2025 - May 2025

- Implemented core storage and query execution components for a database
  management system
- Developed a slotted-page storage manager in to support variable-length data
  tuples within fixed-size pages, implementing serialization and
  deserialization of metadata
- Wrote low-level I/O methods to handle binary page storage and recovery,
  ensuring data integrity through checksum and logging.
- Worked extensively with Rust's memory safety model, lifetimes, and trait-based
  abstractions to implement robust and type-safe systems code.

### [Last Stand](https://github.com/mutrera-2004/UH2025) | *Python* | March 2025

- Developed a top-down zombie survival shooter game with the `pygame` library
  for the 2025 Uncommon Hacks hackathon at UChicago

### [K Malloc](https://github.com/keyaloding/kmalloc) | *C* | March 2025

- Developed a custom dynamic memory allocator to manage heap memory efficiently
- Implemented memory allocation using `mmap()`, expanding the heap dynamically
  based on process demands
- Handled memory fragmentation and coalescing, improving performance and
  reducing wasted space

### [Unix Shell](https://github.com/keyaloding/shell) | *C, Unix* | February 2025

- Developed a Unix-like shell in C, implementing process creation and management
  with system calls
- Applied defensive programming techniques to handle invalid user input, prevent
  buffer overflows, and ensure robust error handling, improving the shell's
  stability and security
- Implemented input/output redirection to support file-based command execution
  and automated testing
- Designed a modular architecture by structuring the shell's core
  functionalities into separate components, making the codebase extensible for
  future enhancements such as piping and background process execution

### [Topsy-Turvy](https://github.com/keyaloding/topsy-turvy) | *C, POSIX Threads* | December 2024

- Created a terminal-based game with efficient data structures including doubly
  linked lists and designed modular game logic using structs for scalable and
  maintainable code
- Optimized memory usage by implementing bit-packing techniques and validated
  code integrity using Valgrind for memory leak detection
- Improved performance and concurrency by leveraging pthreads for
  multithreading, ensuring responsive gameplay even with complex board state
  updates.
- Implemented unit testing with the Criterion framework and systematic
  debugging using LLDB

### [NASA Space Apps Challenge](https://github.com/keyaloding/nasa-space-apps) | *Python* | October 2024

- Designed a website during a 30-hour hackathon that allows users to explore an
  artificial version of Earth in which chemosynthesis sustains all life, using a
  3D molecule visualizer, interactive food web builder, and interactive
  simulator that shows organisms found in oceanic depths
- Placed in the top 10 out of 71 teams.
