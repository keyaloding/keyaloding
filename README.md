### Vertex Inc, *Software Engineer I*, August 2026 - ...

### Vertex Inc, *Software Engineering Intern*, June 2025 - August 2025
  - Analyzed and optimized product performance using profiling tools,
  performance models, and queueing theory as a member of the Performance
  Engineering team
  - Designed an API to collect performance metrics from DataDog and translate
  them to queueing theory metrics, enabling deeper performance analysis of the
  company’s tax software services
  - Developed and executed automated performance tests to measure system
  scalability, identify bottlenecks, and validate enhancements across
  distributed systems
  - Assisted in building and refining CI/CD pipelines and monitoring
  infrastructure using AWS cloud technologies and DevOps best practices

### Salk Institute for Biological Studies, *Software Engineering Intern*, June 2024 - October 2024
  - Optimized a machine learning model for pose estimation, reducing error
  rates by 13% and improving accuracy by 9% through hyperparameter tuning and
  regularization
  - Developed a real-time visualization web app using the pygfx Python library
  to enable interactive exploration of pose estimation results
  - Integrated .nwb (Neurodata Without Borders) data support, streamlining data
  standardization and interoperability across neurophysiology workflows
  - Expanded video file representation classes by incorporating additional
  metadata, improving data handling and analysis capabilities

### UChicago Department of Medicine, *Data Science Intern*, February 2024 - May 2024
  - Developed and optimized Python scripts to analyze large-scale electronic
    biobanks, studying cardiovascular disease through longitudinal analysis,
    mixed-effects modeling, and regression
  - Used bioinformatics methods for population genetics studies, such as
    genome-wide association studies, QTL mapping, polygenetic risk prediction,
    and pleiotropy analysis

### [CrustyDB](https://github.com/uchicago-cmsc23500-spr-2025/crustydb-keyaloding), *Rust*, April 2025 - May 2025
- Implemented core storage and query execution components for a database
  management system
- Developed a slotted-page storage manager in to support variable-length data
  tuples within fixed-size pages, implementing serialization and
  deserialization of metadata
- Wrote low-level I/O methods to handle binary page storage and recovery,
  ensuring data integrity through checksum and logging.
- Worked extensively with Rust's memory safety model, lifetimes, and trait-based
  abstractions to implement robust and type-safe systems code.

### [Last Stand](https://github.com/mutrera-2004/UH2025), *Python*, March 2025
- Developed a top-down zombie survival shooter game with the `pygame` library
  for the 2025 Uncommon Hacks hackathon at UChicago

### [K Malloc](https://github.com/keyaloding/kmalloc), *C*, March 2025
- Developed a custom dynamic memory allocator to manage heap memory efficiently
- Implemented memory allocation using `mmap()`, expanding the heap dynamically
  based on process demands
- Handled memory fragmentation and coalescing, improving performance and
  reducing wasted space

### [Unix Shell](https://github.com/keyaloding/shell), *C, Unix*, February 2025
- Developed a Unix-like shell in C, implementing process creation and management
  with system calls
- Applied defensive programming techniques to handle invalid user input, prevent
  buffer overflows, and ensure robust error handling, improving the shell's
  stability and security
- Implemented input/output redirection to support file-based command execution
  and automated testing
- Designed a modular architecture by structuring the shell's core
  functionalities into separate components, making the codebase extensible for
  future enhancements such as piping and background process execution

### [Topsy-Turvy](https://github.com/keyaloding/topsy-turvy), *C, POSIX Threads*, December 2024
- Created a terminal-based game with efficient data structures including doubly
  linked lists and designed modular game logic using structs for scalable and
  maintainable code
- Optimized memory usage by implementing bit-packing techniques and validated
  code integrity using Valgrind for memory leak detection
- Improved performance and concurrency by leveraging pthreads for
  multithreading, ensuring responsive gameplay even with complex board state
  updates.
- Implemented unit testing with the Criterion framework and systematic
  debugging using LLDB

### [NASA Space Apps Challenge](https://github.com/keyaloding/nasa-space-apps), *Python*, October 2024
- Designed a website during a 30-hour hackathon that allows users to explore an
  artificial version of Earth in which chemosynthesis sustains all life, using a
  3D molecule visualizer, interactive food web builder, and interactive
  simulator that shows organisms found in oceanic depths
- Placed in the top 10 out of 71 teams.
